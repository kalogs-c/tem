# Tem

A simple csv finder, that I've made to help me at work.

## Usage

```bash
# Compile using make
make cp

# Run
./tem "<search term>" <csv file> <output file>
# The search term can be a string or a regex
# output file is optional
```

## Install

If you are on Linux, you can install it with:

```bash
make build
```
